This was a weekend project I created that consisted of the following:
* Building and populating my own real estate database with an automated script.
* Displaying Houston home price change percentage on a heatmap.

The red locations on the map show areas that have the highest percent change in home price from 2017 to 2018. 

This database and visual display will serve to help myself and other real estate investors make better data-driven decisions when investing in the Houston market.
